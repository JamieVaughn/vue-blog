## Let's start with the Demo


<GenUUID />

```js
const uuid = () => {
    let url = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob())
    return URL.revokeObjectURL(url) || url.split('/')[3]
}
// or

const uuid = (url = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob())) => (
    URL.revokeObjectURL(url) || url.split('/')[3]
)
```

This is available in Web Workers (but not in Service Workers)

This generates a UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier) as specificed in the File API spcification on [step 9 of the procedure for generating a new blob URL](https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/#unicodeBlobURL).

> An example of a blob URL that can be generated by this algorithm is blob:https://example.org/40a5fb5a-d56d-4a33-b4e2-0acf6a8e5f641.


>  A UUID is 128 bits long, and can guarantee
>  uniqueness across space and time.  UUIDs were originally used in the
>  Apollo Network Computing System and later in the Open Software
>  Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment (DCE), and then
>  in Microsoft Windows platforms.
