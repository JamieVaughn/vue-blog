Most event-based programming whether it is for UI or not needs a way to map soem list of actions or inputs to blocks of logic to execute. Procedural Programming may not need this because the entire program is expected to run synchronously and in order. But when responding to events, code will not execute in a predictable order necesitating the use of asynchronous code and a good way to organize the possible blocks of logic that may need to run at these asynchronous times. The Asynchronicity is handle by other patterns (Promises, Futures, Observables Pub/Sub, etc.) but for organizing the callbacks of these patterns lets take a look at some hash table implementations. These kinds of implementations appear commonly in state management libraries like Redux and XState to manage state, dispatchers, and actions which may be triggered or transformed within a user interface.

## A Few Options for Authoring Hash Tables in JS

* If statements (conventional or ternary)
* Switch Statements
* Objects/Maps (Lookup Tables)

First we have the humble If statement control flow implementation in both conventional and ternary syntax:

```js
function getSound(str){
  return test === 'cat' ? 'meow' : 
         test === 'cow' ? 'moo' : 
         test === 'dog' ? 'woof' : 
         test === 'bird' ? 'chirp' : 
         test === 'frog' ? 'ribit' : 
         'silence'
}

// or the same thing but with conventional if/else if/else syntax:

function getSoundConv(str){
    if(str === 'cat') return 'meow' 
    else if(str === 'cow') return 'moo' 
    else if(str === 'dog') return 'woof' 
    else if(str === 'bird') return 'chirp' 
    else if(str === 'frog') return 'ribit'
    else return 'silence'
}

```
Control flow implementations necessarily introduce [cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity) which introduces branching logic in ones code. This is considered somewhat of a code smell in the Functional Paradigm, mainly because it imposes a cost on its level of readability. The next two implementations avoid the control flow pattern and thus reduce cyclomatic complexity. They make it eaiser to map pieces of UI directly to block of logic, rather than routing multiple UI into one imperative block of logic that the control flow must untangle.

Next we have a hash table implemented via a switch statement:

```js
function switchSound(str) {
  switch(str) {
    case 'cat': return 'meow'
    case 'dog': return 'woof'
    case 'cow': return 'moo'
    case 'bird': return 'chirp'
    case 'frog': return 'ribit'
    default: return 'silence'
  }
}
```
And next we have an example of a Hash Table Lookup function:

```js
function lookupSound(str) {
  return {
    cat: 'meow',
    dog: 'woof',
    cow: 'moo',
    bird: 'chirp',
    frog: 'ribit',
  }[str] ?? 'silence'
}
```
The above implementation uses plain JS objects, but would look about the same using a Map() or WeakMap().


All of the functions above will provide an easy API for retrieving values by passing in a simple enum. 
We can test the functions with something simple to inspect their output and we would get something like this:

```js
console.log(getSound('dog'))   // 'woof'
console.log(getSoundConv('cow'))   // 'moo'
console.log(switchSound('cat'))   // 'meow'
console.log(lookupSound('snake')) // 'silence'
```

### Which to favor?

This is subjective as any of the styles works and is basically fine. The decision of which to use comes down to two things, I think: (1) Readability and (2) Extensibility.

In my opinion, both of the if statement styles are the least readable. The conventional if statement style would at least offer you better extensibility as you can more easily use multilines to use more complex logic. But the extensibility is at least matched by the switch and lookup styles, so I think its safe to lay the if statement styles to rest and continue with considering only the next two styles.

But between the switch style and the lookup style, I think a fair argument could be made in either case. However, I would give the lookup style a slight edge because as an object, it is quite literally a map or a hash table. So it is the thing we set out to recreate, meaning what we see is what we want it to be and not some adaptation or hack. I'd give the edge to the lookup table syntax.

In terms of extensibility, both the switch and lookup styles permit multiline space for complex logic. Both can be adapted to use a more declarative style and less of an imperative style in our code by return a function instead of executing procedural logic. The switch statement case block and the lookup table allows convenient non-colocated function definitions to be mapped to the keys or case value without being invoked inline, meaning we can more easily pass the funciton around our program for lazy execution and taking better advantage of closures. Both equally reduce cyclomatic complexity by mapping an enum directly to a block of logic, which reduces code branching unlike the if statements.

Perhaps the one distinction is the switch statement has more flexibility than the lookup table by not being constrained only to enums as an access API. The switch statement can also accomodate comparisons to map to execution blocks, which may suit ones program in particular situations. In most situations enums are prefered and are quite good enough, but have that additional flexibility may explain why switch statements do seem more popular in Reducer libraries in funcitonal communities like React and Redux.

### Use Cases

A common use cases for this pattern is for mapping blocks of code to execute for each UI element that triggers an event. A pitfall that leads to unnecessary cyclomatic complexity is relying on a single function as a callback when any one of an entire group of buttons is clicked. This callback would typically work out which code to execute within the function by using control flow to check either some background global state or checking some flag parameter that is passed in. 

The hash table pattern lets us separate out the logic of determining which code block to execute into its own structure (i.e. one of the lookup functions above) and then the return value from that lookup table would be the ultimate code block that needs to be executed givent the triggering event. Emerging from this pattern is that the control flow mentioned in the previous paragraph simply falls away if the UI is setup accordingly. The UI can contain the enum value that will be carried in the event that bubbles so that the lookup table can retrieve the correct function without any control flow. This is what is meant by "pushing cyclomatic complexity out". The logic branching still technically exists in the program, but we've pushed it all the way into the UI layer (instead of in the business logic layer) so that the "branching" is now actually occuring at the step of the user input which means the branching never actually appears in the code itself.

##### An Example

Lets take a simple contrived example of a drop down menu:

The HTML might be something like this:
```html
Listen to an animal's call:
<select name="choices" id="choices" onchange='lookupSound(event.target.value)'>
  <option value="dog">Dog</option>
  <option value="cat">Cat</option>
  <option value="bird">Bird/option>
  <option value="cow">Cow</option>
  <option value="bear">Bear</option>
</select>

<img src="" alt="animal" id="selection">
```
And the javascript can use one of our lookup tables from before, which you'll notice we can easily extend with a new `bear` field. We can also keep unused fields without consequence, like `frog`, which might be used in another UI component but won't be used in this one, and it will safely be inert here:
```js
function lookupSound(str) {
  return {
    cat: soundAction(str, 'meow'),
    dog: soundAction(str, 'woof'),
    cow: soundAction(str, 'moo'),
    bird: soundAction(str, 'chirp'),
    frog: soundAction(str, 'ribit'),
    bear: soundAction(str, 'roar'),
  }[str] ?? soundAction(str, 'silence')
}

function soundAction(str, sound) {
    console.log(sound)
    img.setAttribute('src', `https://pictureof${str}.com/200/300`)
}
```

We've also added a new function called `soundAction`, which can be the composable function that holds the actual business logic code block that should be run upon the event being triggered. It can contain any arbitrary logic, and of course different functions can be mapped to different lookup table fields as needed for customizability. In this example, the busines logic just logs the animal sound and populates an image of the animal from a hypothetical animal picture API.

With this kind of organization, you'll notice there are no if statements and no conventional control flow which means we keep our cyclomatic complexity to a minimum. We've pushed all of the logic branching up the UI layer (which is as high as it can go) and we allow the event system itself to pass the information needed to run the correct code block.
