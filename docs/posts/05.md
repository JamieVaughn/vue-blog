The Null Object Pattern is a common way in OOP to handle `null` references in a graceful way. If a reference to an object is `null` and a method is invoked on that reference, then this will cause an error. Instead, a Null Object can be implemented with the same interface, but where the methods are no-op methods. Other objects can inherit from this Null Object in such a way, that if a `null` reference is passed then they will use the no-op methods from the Null Object rather than throwing an error. 

## Typical OOP implementation in JS

```js
class Discount {
  calculateDiscount() {
    return this.discount;
  }
}
class NoDiscount {
  calculateDiscount() {
    return 0;
  }
}
function getChildren(orderType) {
  return orderType === 'matinée' ? new LeafNode() : new Node();
}

[new Order(new Discount'matinée'), null].map(o => )
```
Using the null object pattern, a special version of the method is created that only handles `null` values and mitigates the need for more tedious control flow logic that checks for `null` values in the original class interface.
